# 🌙 Low-Light Image Enhancement and Noise Removal for Lunar Mapping

> A **transformer-based pipeline** that combines **LLFormer** and **Restormer** to enhance low-light lunar images captured from Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs). The pipeline first enhances image illumination using LLFormer and then removes residual noise using Restormer, producing high-quality images for lunar surface analysis and mapping.

# 📖 Overview

Lunar images captured from Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) often suffer from extremely low illumination, poor contrast, and noise, making scientific analysis difficult. This project proposes a **transformer-based pipeline** where **LLFormer** enhances the low-light image and **Restormer** restores the enhanced image by removing residual noise. The final output provides improved visibility, preserved surface details, and enhanced image quality suitable for lunar mapping and exploration.

# ✨ Key Features

* Transformer-based image enhancement pipeline
* Low-light enhancement using **LLFormer**
* Image denoising using **Restormer**
* Image normalization and resizing (256 × 256)
* Enhanced lunar surface visualization
* Preservation of structural details and textures
* High-quality output for lunar mapping

---

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The proposed architecture consists of three major components:

### **Input Layer**

* Accepts low-light lunar images.
* Performs image normalization and resizing to **256 × 256**.

### **Processing Core**

* **LLFormer:** Enhances illumination and image contrast.
* **Restormer:** Removes residual noise while preserving image details.

### **User Application Layer**

* Displays or stores the enhanced image for visualization, 3D mapping, AI-based evaluation, and lunar surface analysis.
